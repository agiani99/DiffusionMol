# DiffusionMol
Example of a diffusion model to rebuild ligand into cavities.

The demo run is based on PDB:1hgs and ligand MK1 or on PDB:4tcz (CRBN) and ligand EF2 (pomalidomide)

Create an environment through requirements.txt

Activate it and run the notebook or python fixed_diffusion_notebook.py

Reminder: change the smiles template for ligand wtihin the notebook and the script (known_ligand)

Have fun!
